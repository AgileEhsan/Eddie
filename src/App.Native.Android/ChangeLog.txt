Some of them have been adapted and/or fixed, some used "as is", some other discarded in favor of a complete rewrite of the same service or activity in order to fully comply to Android native development (although in regard of Visual Studio, C# and Mono). In particular, org.airvpn.eddie development has been and mainly focused on Xamarin.Forms complete removal from the former project, removal of obsolete Android preferences/setting classes in favor of valid and supported level classes; this also included the complete removal of Xam.Plugins.Settings in favor of standard Android's SharedPrefs schema.
